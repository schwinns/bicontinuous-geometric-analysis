METADATA FOR GEOMETRIC PORE-TO-PORE DISTANCE DISTRIBUTIONS

Data were generated with the following command:
    python geometric_analysis.py -s gyroid schwarz primitive -n 10000 -o pore2pore

This produces probability density distributions for each of the three space groups using 10,000 samples.

The hard-coded parameters for this analysis are:
    n, grid size of 100 by 100 by 100 for the discretized nodal approximations
    box, 9.4 nm -- experimental unit cell size
    struct_tol, 0.01 -- tolerance for discretized points on surface
    guess, 4.6 nm -- initial guess for the pore-to-pore distance from bilayer simulation

The kernel density estimation used to smooth the distribution was a Gaussian kernel.
    Bandwidth was determined by 10-fold cross-validation -- 0.1 for every space group
