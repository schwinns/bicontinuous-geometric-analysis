	abstract = {Computing equilibrium states in condensed-matter many-body systems, such as solvated proteins, is a long-standing challenge. Lacking methods for generating statistically independent equilibrium samples in “one shot,” vast computational effort is invested for simulating these systems in small steps, e.g., using molecular dynamics. Combining deep learning and statistical mechanics, we developed Boltzmann generators, which are shown to generate unbiased one-shot equilibrium samples of representative condensed-matter systems and proteins. Boltzmann generators use neural networks to learn a coordinate transformation of the complex configurational equilibrium distribution to a distribution that can be easily sampled. Accurate computation of free-energy differences and discovery of new configurations are demonstrated, providing a statistical mechanics tool that can avoid rare events during sampling without prior knowledge of reaction coordinates.},

	abstract = {Periodic, nanostructured porous polymer membranes made from the cross-linked inverted hexagonal phase of self-assembled lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs) are a promising class of materials for selective separations. In this work, we investigate an experimentally characterized LLC polymer membrane using atomistic molecular modeling. In particular, we compare simulated X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) patterns with experimental XRD data to quantify and understand the diﬀerences between simulation and experiment. We ﬁnd that the nanopores are likely composed of ﬁve columns of stacked LLC monomers which surround each hydrophilic core. Evidence suggests that these columns likely move independently of each other over longer time scales than accessible via atomistic simulation. We also ﬁnd that wide-angle X-ray scattering structural features previously attributed to monomer tail tilt are likely instead due to ordered tail packing. Although this system has been reported as dry, we show that small amounts of water are necessary to reproduce all features from the experimental XRD pattern because of asymmetries introduced by hydrogen bonds between the monomer head groups and water molecules. Finally, we explore the composition and structure of the nanopores and reveal that there exists a composition gradient rather than an abrupt partition between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. A caveat is that the time scales of the dynamics are extremely long for this system, resulting in simulated structures that appear too ordered, thus requiring careful examination of the metastable states observed in order to draw any conclusions. The clear picture of the nanoscopic structure of these membranes provided in this study will enable a better understanding of the mechanisms of smallmolecule transport within these nanopores.},

In this work, we observe the transport of water, sodium ions, and 20 small polar solutes within the pores of a lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) membrane using atomistic molecular simulations. We ﬁnd that the transport of a species is dependent not only on molecular size but also on chemical functionality. The membrane’s inhomogeneous composition gives rise to radially dependent transport mechanisms with respect to the pore centers. We observe that all solutes perform intermittent hops between lengthy periods of entrapment. Three diﬀerent trapping mechanisms are responsible for this behavior. First, solutes that drift out of the pore can become entangled among the dense monomer tails. Second, solutes can donate hydrogen bonds to the monomer head groups. Third, solutes can coordinate with sodium counterions. The degree to which a solute is aﬀected by each mechanism is dependent on the chemical functionality of the solute. Using the insights developed in this study, we can begin to think about how to redesign existing LLC membranes to perform solute-speciﬁc separations.},

	abstract = {Appropriate time series modeling of complex diﬀusion in soft matter systems on the microsecond time scale can provide a path toward inferring transport mechanisms and predicting bulk properties characteristic of much longer time scales. In this work we apply nonparametric Bayesian time series analysis, more speciﬁcally the sticky hierarchical Dirichlet process autoregressive hidden Markov model (HDP-AR-HMM) to solute center-of-mass trajectories generated from long molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in a cross-linked inverted hexagonal phase lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) membrane in order to automatically detect a variety of solute dynamical modes. We can better understand the mechanisms controlling these dynamical modes by grouping the states identiﬁed by the HDP-AR-HMM into clusters based on multiple metrics aimed at distinguishing solute behavior based on their ﬂuctuations, dwell times in each state, and positions within the inhomogeneous membrane structure. We analyze predominant clusters in order to relate their dynamical parameters to physical interactions between solutes and the membrane. Along with parameters of individual states, the HDP-AR-HMM simultaneously infers a transition matrix which allows us to stochastically propagate solute behavior from all of the independent trajectories onto arbitrary length time scales while still preserving the qualitative behavior characteristic of the MD trajectories. This aﬀords a direct connection to important macroscopic observables used to characterize performance like solute ﬂux and selectivity. This work provides a promising way to simultaneously identify transport mechanisms in nanoporous materials and project complex diﬀusive behavior on long time scales. Our enhanced understanding of the diverse range of solute behavior allows us to hypothesize design changes to LLC monomers aimed toward controlling the rates of solute passage, thus improving the selective performance of LLC membranes.},

	abstract = {Transmembrane protein channels, including ion channels and aquaporins that are responsible for fast and selective transport of water, have inspired membrane scientists to exploit and mimic their performance in membrane technologies. These biomimetic membranes comprise discrete nanochannels aligned within amphiphilic matrices on a robust support. While biological components have been used directly, extensive work has also been conducted to produce stable synthetic mimics of protein channels and lipid bilayers. However, the experimental performance of biomimetic membranes remains far below that of biological membranes. In this review, we critically assess the status and potential of biomimetic desalination membranes. We ﬁrst review channel chemistries and their transport behavior, identifying key characteristics to optimize water permeability and salt rejection. We compare various channel types within an industrial context, considering transport performance, processability, and stability. Through a re-examination of previous vesicular stopped-ﬂow studies, we demonstrate that incorrect permeability equations result in an overestimation of the water permeability of nanochannels. We ﬁnd in particular that the most optimized aquaporin-bearing bilayer had a pure water permeability of 2.1 L m−2 h−1 bar−1, which is comparable to that of current stateof-the-art polymeric desalination membranes. Through a quantitative assessment of biomimetic membrane formats, we analytically show that formats incorporating intact vesicles oﬀer minimal beneﬁt, whereas planar biomimetic selective layers could allow for dramatically improved salt rejections. We then show that the persistence of nanoscale defects explains observed subpar performance. We conclude with a discussion on optimal strategies for minimizing these defects, which could enable breakthrough performance.},

	abstract = {In water remediation, biomimetic membranes are gaining much attention due to their selectivity, dynamic stability, nontoxicity, and biocompatibility. Lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs) are self-organizing networks that can conform to an array of geometries with high pore densities. As such, LLCs are excellent membrane materials for water applications because they are water insoluble and are manipulated to conform to an array of morphologies that provide natural water channels that are readily tunable in size. They have the ability to create uniform pores, between the range of 1 and 5 nm, with large surface areas. Thus, this work focuses on the design, fabrication, and characterization of LLC-modiﬁed Janus-type membranes for forward osmosis applications. Physical characterization of the membranes was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the results show an open-pore radius and the presence of both ﬁnger- and sponge-like pores depending on membrane preparation. The contact angle assessment indicates that as the membranes are further modiﬁed with other polymers (e.g., PAN), higher hydrophilicity and surface energy are achieved. Moreover, the Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) analysis showed a signiﬁcant variation in the pore distribution between membranes. Functionalized membranes presented satisfactory water ﬂux and superior salt rejection compared to nonfunctionalized membranes. SupPACMoDS membranes are 83\% more eﬃcient at preventing salt back ﬂux than the nonmodiﬁed version. This is credited to the thickness and pore structure provided by the PAN support layer in the membrane.},

	abstract = {Narrow hydrophobic regions are a common feature of biological channels, with possible roles in ion-channel gating. We study the principles that govern ion transport through narrow hydrophobic membrane pores by molecular dynamics simulation of model membranes formed of hexagonally packed carbon nanotubes. We focus on the factors that determine the energetics of ion translocation through such nonpolar nanopores and compare the resulting free-energy barriers for pores with different diameters corresponding to the gating regions in closed and open forms of potassium channels. Our model system also allows us to compare the results from molecular dynamics simulations directly to continuum electrostatics calculations. Both simulations and continuum calculations show that subnanometer wide pores pose a huge free-energy barrier for ions, but a small increase in the pore diameter to ;1 nm nearly eliminates that barrier. We also ﬁnd that in those wider channels the ion mobility is comparable to that in the bulk phase. By calculating local electrostatic potentials, we show that the long range Coulomb interactions of ions are strongly screened in the wide water-ﬁlled channels. Whereas continuum calculations capture the overall energetics reasonably well, the local water structure, which is not accounted for in this model, leads to interesting effects such as the preference of hydrated ions to move along the pore wall rather than through the center of the pore.},

	abstract = {From feasibility tests at laboratory scale to large industrial scale processes, modelling can be applied to Organic Solvent Nanoﬁltration (OSN) for two purposes: (i) parameter estimation, when experimental data for standard solute þ solvent systems are available, and it is desired to estimate relevant parameters for as yet uncharacterised systems, and (ii) prediction, when the model parameters for the solvent–solute are available, and modelling can be applied to describe the performance of a different solute þ solvent system or operations at a different process scale. Both estimation and prediction require the choice of a transport model, to carry out regression and simulation, respectively. This paper reports a systematic comparison of a range of different transport models (irreversible thermodynamics, solution–diffusion, pore-ﬂow and transient transport models, such as the solution–diffusion with imperfections model) using selected experimental data for various solutes and solvents through polymeric OSN membranes with different physico-chemical properties. Commercial integrally skinned asymmetric polyimide (PI, glassy) and thin ﬁlm composite silicone-coated PI (rubbery) membranes from Evoniks MET were systematically tested in this study, with styrene oligomers and Safranin-O dye in different organic solvents under uniform operating conditions (temperature, pressure, cross-ﬂow velocity and solute concentration). In addition, experimental data from the literature were taken for non-commercial thin ﬁlm composite silicone-coated PI, glassy poly[1(trimethylsilyl)-1-propyne] (PTMSP) and poly[4methyl2pentyne] (PMP) membranes, to include a broad spectrum of positive and negative rejection values. The different transport models were used to perform regression of experimental data and prediction at different pressure values, based on the regressed model parameters. The models were then compared in terms of regression performance and experimental/ numerical effort required to use them for parameter estimation. Negative rejection data was used to further discriminate among the models. Solution–diffusion-based models gave a better description of permeation through ﬂexible-chain glassy membranes than pore-ﬂow models. On the other hand, pore-ﬂow-based models gave a better description of permeation through glassy PTMSP and PMP membranes. For integrally skinned asymmetric PI membranes, the prediction of a concentration process using the best performing regression models (i.e. the Maxwell–Stefan and the classical solution–diffusion model) was also performed. Interestingly, no signiﬁcant difference was observed between the two models for both a membrane with complete solute rejection (Duramems 200) and a membrane with partial solute rejection (Duramems 500). Process modelling by accounting for a classical solution–diffusion-type transport mechanism is therefore sufﬁcient to obtain a reliable transport description for this membrane family.},

	abstract = {Classical molecular dynamics simulates the time evolution of molecular systems through the phase space spanned by the positions and velocities of the constituent atoms. Molecular-level thermodynamic, kinetic, and structural data extracted from the resulting trajectories provide valuable information for the understanding, engineering, and design of biological and molecular materials. The cost of simulating many-body atomic systems makes simulations of large molecules prohibitively expensive, and the high-dimensionality of the resulting trajectories presents a challenge for analysis. Driven by advances in algorithms, hardware, and data availability, there has been a flare of interest in recent years in the applications of machine learning – especially deep learning – to molecular simulation. These techniques have demonstrated great power and flexibility in both extracting mechanistic understanding of the important nonlinear collective variables governing the dynamics of a molecular system, and in furnishing good low-dimensional system representations with which to perform enhanced sampling or develop long-timescale dynamical models. It is the purpose of this article to introduce the key machine learning approaches, describe how they are married with statistical mechanical theory into domain-specific tools, and detail applications of these approaches in understanding and accelerating biomolecular simulation.},

	abstract = {We propose a deep generative Markov State Model (DeepGenMSM) learning framework for inference of metastable dynamical systems and prediction of trajectories. After unsupervised training on time series data, the model contains (i) a probabilistic encoder that maps from high-dimensional conﬁguration space to a small-sized vector indicating the membership to metastable (long-lived) states, (ii) a Markov chain that governs the transitions between metastable states and facilitates analysis of the long-time dynamics, and (iii) a generative part that samples the conditional distribution of conﬁgurations in the next time step. The model can be operated in a recursive fashion to generate trajectories to predict the system evolution from a deﬁned starting state and propose new conﬁgurations. The DeepGenMSM is demonstrated to provide accurate estimates of the long-time kinetics and generate valid distributions for molecular dynamics (MD) benchmark systems. Remarkably, we show that DeepGenMSMs are able to make long timesteps in molecular conﬁguration space and generate physically realistic structures in regions that were not seen in training data.},

Here, we show a strategy to design solid-state nanopores that selectively transport potassium ions and show negligible conductance for sodium ions. The nanopores contain walls decorated with 4′-aminobenzo-18-crown-6 ether and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules located at one pore entrance. The ionic selectivity stems from facilitated transport of potassium ions in the pore region containing crown ether, while the highly charged ssDNA plays the role of a cation filter. Achieving potassium selectivity in solid-state nanopores opens new avenues toward advanced separation processes, more efficient biosensing technologies, and novel biomimetic nanopore systems.},

Self-assembly processes of amphiphiles have been widely used to mimic biological systems, such as assembly of lipids and proteins, while their integrated actions allow the performance of highly specific cellular functions which has paved a way for bottom-up bionanotechnology. While amphiphiles self-assembly has attracted considerable attention for decades due to their extensive applications in material science, drug and gene delivery, recent developments in nanoscience stimulated the combination of the simple approaches of amphiphile assembly with the advanced concept of supramolecular self-assembly for the development of more complex, hierarchical nanostructures. Introduction of stimulus responsive supramolecular amphiphile assembly-disassembly processes provides particularly novel approaches for impacting bionanotechnology applications. Leading examples of these novel self-assembly processes can be found, in fact, in biosystems where assemblies of different amphiphilic macrocomponents and their integrated actions allow the performance of highly specific biological functions. In this perspective, we summarize in this tutorial review the basic concept and recent research on self-assembly of traditional amphiphilic molecules (such as surfactants, amphiphile-like polymers, or lipids) and more recent concepts of supramolecular amphiphiles assembly which have become increasingly important in emerging nanotechnology.},

Membranes in lamellar phase are ubiquitous in cellular compartments and can phase-separate upon mixing lipids in different liquid-crystalline states. Hexagonal phases and especially cubic phases can be synthesized and observed in vivo as well. Membrane often closes up into a vesicle whose shape is determined by the interplay of curvature, area difference elasticity and line tension energies, and can adopt the form of a sphere, a tube, a prolate, a starfish and many more. Complexes made of lipids and polyelectrolytes or inorganic materials exhibit a rich diversity of structural morphologies due to additional interactions which become increasingly hard to track without the aid of suitable computer models.

The formation of D−A interfaces with diﬀerent (solvent-dependent) characteristics was veriﬁed by steady-state photoluminescence and morphological and electrical measurements. These measurements show a rather comparable device eﬃciency of the PTB7-th:ITIC BHJ processed by o-MA (compared to the device processed using o-DCB) despite the lower absorption of the ﬁlms and the lower VOC. Also, the charge-transfer (CT) state formation was investigated and the reasons behind the VOC losses were correlated to the interface variations when processed by diﬀerent solvents. Some experimental results are then discussed in light of the electronic structure of the molecules calculated using the density functional theory (DFT) method. The comparison between the experimental data and the theoretical calculations give some insights about the microscopic processes involved in the variation of the devices properties processed using the o-DCB and o-Ma solvents. We concluded that the D−A distance clearly aﬀects the CT state energy and consequently the VOC. Furthermore, higher air stability is observed when the active layer is processed using o-MA instead of oDCB. The better stability was observed in self-lifetime measurements and air-processed devices.},

On the basis of their locations on the phase diagram, their powder X-ray diffraction profiles, and the physical properties of the cross-linked materials, the QI phases formed by these gemini monomers are consistent with four possible bicontinuous cubic architectures with P or I space group symmetry that have been identified previously for small molecule amphiphiles. The extent of polymerization (i.e., the degree of diene conversion) achieved in the LLC phases was determined to be in the 23\% to 71\% range using UV-vis spectrometry, which is more than sufficient to extensively stabilize the systems. The resulting cross-linked HI, LR, and QI phases are stable up to 300 °C in air. To our knowledge, these reactive amphiphiles constitute the first example of a polymerizable gemini surfactant, and the first example of a cross-linkable amphiphile system that can be polymerized in both the HI and a QI mesophase with retention of phase microstructure.},

          , 
            
              For organic semiconductors, the solid-state packing of the π-conjugated molecules or polymers dictate the material electronic, optical, and mechanical characteristics. Combinations of solution and solid-state investigations are often used to establish structure–function relationships, though these connections are often loosely correlated, and experiments in different laboratories can lead to widely variable interpretations. Hence, there remains a need to develop a deeper, more robust understanding of the connections between molecular and polymer chemistry, structure, processing, solid-state order, and materials properties to enable judicious materials design principles. Towards this goal, we employ fully-atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-

The MD simulations make use of polymer lengths (molecular weights) and solution concentrations that are consistent with those used in experiment, allowing for a detailed picture to arise as to how variations in the polymer environment can direct polymer structure. Comparisons between experiment and theory suggest that processing history can be an important factor in the polymer structures presumed experimentally that are used to interpret optical and electronic responses. The results of these simulations provide specific information into the behavior of PTB7 under different conditions, and showcase how atomistic MD simulations that approach experimentally relevant sizes can be used to develop broader chemical insight that can aid in the design, processing, and characterization of polymer-based organic semiconductors.},

              A series of acceptors,

              , has been designed based on the acceptor–π–donor–π–acceptor (A–π–D–π–A) architecture by incorporating a phenothiazine unit as the central donor unit. Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) methods have been employed to study the effect of various end-capped groups on the geometric, electronic, optical and charge transport properties of the designed acceptor molecules. The results reveal that on increasing the electron-withdrawing nature of the end-capped groups, the performance of the acceptor molecules increases. It is also observed that on increasing the flexibility of the end-capped groups, the planarity of the molecules gets destroyed and, as a result, the performance of the acceptor molecules decreases. The investigated molecules exhibit high electron affinity (EA) and low reorganization energy for electrons (
              λ

	abstract = {To simultaneously achieve low photon energy loss (Eloss) and broad spectral response, the molecular design of the wide band gap (WBG) donor polymer with a deep HOMO level is of critical importance in fullerene-free polymer solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we developed a new benzodithiophene unit, i.e., DTBDT-EF, and conducted systematic investigations on a WBG DTBDT-EF-based donor polymer, namely, PDTB-EF-T. Due to the synergistic electron-withdrawing eﬀect of the ﬂuorine atom and ester group, PDTB-EFT exhibits a higher oxidation potential, i.e., a deeper HOMO level (ca. −5.5 eV) than most well-known donor polymers. Hence, a high open-circuit voltage of 0.90 V was obtained when paired with a ﬂuorinated small molecule acceptor (IT-4F), corresponding to a low Eloss of 0.62 eV. Furthermore, side-chain engineering demonstrated that subtle side-chain modulation of the ester greatly inﬂuences the aggregation eﬀects and molecular packing of polymer PDTB-EF-T. With the beneﬁts of the stronger interchain π−π interaction, the improved ordering structure, and thus the highest hole mobility, the most symmetric charge transport and reduced recombination are achieved for the linear decyl-substituted PDTB-EF-T (P2)-based PSCs, leading to the highest short-circuit current density and ﬁll factor (FF). Due to the high Flory−Huggins interaction parameter (χ), surface-directed phase separation occurs in the P2:IT-4F blend, which is supported by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy results and cross-sectional transmission electron microscope images. By taking advantage of the vertical phase distribution of the P2:IT4F blend, a high power conversion eﬃciency (PCE) of 14.2\% with an outstanding FF of 0.76 was recorded for inverted devices. These results demonstrate the great potential of the DTBDT-EF unit for future organic photovoltaic applications.},

	abstract = {Transmembrane protein channels, including ion channels and aquaporins that are responsible for fast and selective transport of water, have inspired membrane scientists to exploit and mimic their performance in membrane technologies. These biomimetic membranes comprise discrete nanochannels aligned within amphiphilic matrices on a robust support. While biological components have been used directly, extensive work has also been conducted to produce stable synthetic mimics of protein channels and lipid bilayers. However, the experimental performance of biomimetic membranes remains far below that of biological membranes. In this review, we critically assess the status and potential of biomimetic desalination membranes. We ﬁrst review channel chemistries and their transport behavior, identifying key characteristics to optimize water permeability and salt rejection. We compare various channel types within an industrial context, considering transport performance, processability, and stability. Through a re-examination of previous vesicular stopped-ﬂow studies, we demonstrate that incorrect permeability equations result in an overestimation of the water permeability of nanochannels. We ﬁnd in particular that the most optimized aquaporin-bearing bilayer had a pure water permeability of 2.1 L m−2 h−1 bar−1, which is comparable to that of current stateof-the-art polymeric desalination membranes. Through a quantitative assessment of biomimetic membrane formats, we analytically show that formats incorporating intact vesicles oﬀer minimal beneﬁt, whereas planar biomimetic selective layers could allow for dramatically improved salt rejections. We then show that the persistence of nanoscale defects explains observed subpar performance. We conclude with a discussion on optimal strategies for minimizing these defects, which could enable breakthrough performance.},

In lipid membranes research, particle-based molecular simulations are a powerful tool alongside continuum theory, lipidomics, and model, in vitro, and in vivo experiments. Molecular simulations can provide precise and reproducible spatiotemporal (atomic- and femtosecond-level) information about membrane structure, mechanics, thermodynamics, kinetics, and dynamics. Yet the simulation of lipid membranes can be a daunting task, given the uniqueness of lipid membranes relative to conventional liquid-liquid and solid-liquid interfaces, the immense and complex thermodynamic and statistical mechanical theory, the diversity of multiscale lipid models, limitations of modern computing power, the diﬃculty and ambiguity of simulation controls, ﬁnite size eﬀects, competitive continuum simulation alternatives, and the desired application, including vesicle experiments and biological membranes. These issues can complicate an essential understanding of the ﬁeld of lipid membranes, and create major bottlenecks to simulation advancement. In this article, we clarify these issues and present a consistent, thorough, and user-friendly framework for the design of state-of-the-art lipid membrane MD simulations.

We further show that the equilibrium structure of the surfactant molecules inside the cubic phase is very similar to their structure inside a simulated lamellar bilayer. The small differences arise from the packing constraints of the surfactants within the cubic phase which has an area per surfactant that increases toward the bilayer center.},

Although most studies focus on the accuracy of the simulation output compared to experimental data, such a comparison primarily tests the adequacy of the force ﬁeld (i.e., the model). By contrast, the reliability of diﬀerent simulation methodologies for predicting transport properties is the focus of this manuscript. Unfortunately, obtaining reproducible estimates of transport properties from molecular simulation is not as straightforward as static properties. Therefore, this manuscript discusses the best practices that should be followed to ensure that the simulation output is reliable, i.e., is a valid representation of the force ﬁeld implemented. We also discuss procedures to use so that the results are reproducible (i.e., can be obtained by other researchers following the same methods and procedures).},

We report the synthesis and smallangle X-ray scattering (SAXS) characterization of a series of perdeuterated gemini surfactant lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs), in which convex, water-ﬁlled nanopores of welldeﬁned dimensions are lined with carboxylate functionalities. Quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements of the translational water dynamics in these dicarboxylate LLC nanopores as functions of the surfactant hydration state and the charge compensating counterion (Na+, K+, NMe4+) reveal that the measured dynamics depend primarily on surfactant hydration, with an unexpected counterion dependence that varies with hydration number. We rationalize these trends in terms of a balance between counterion−water attractions and the nanopore volume excluded by the counterions. On the basis of electron density maps derived from SAXS analyses of these LLCs, we directly show that the volume excluded by the counterions depends on both their size and spatial distribution in the water-ﬁlled channels. The translational water dynamics in the convex pores of these LLCs are also slower than those reported in the concave pores of AOT reverse micelles, implying that water dynamics also depend on the nanopore curvature.},

We show that in addition to the direct (gas-kinetic) ﬂux of molecules crossing from the bulk phase on one side of the graphene to the bulk phase on the other side, for gases that adsorb onto the graphene, signiﬁcant contribution to the ﬂux across the membrane comes from a surface mechanism by which molecules cross after being adsorbed onto the graphene surface. Our results quantify the relative contribution of the bulk and surface mechanisms and show that the direct ﬂux can be described reasonably accurately using kinetic theory, provided the latter is appropriately modiﬁed assuming steric molecule−pore interactions, with gas molecules behaving as hard spheres of known kinetic diameters. The surface ﬂux is negligible for gases that do not adsorb onto graphene (e.g., He and H2), while for gases that adsorb (e.g., CH4 and N2) it can be on the order of the direct ﬂux or larger. Our results identify a nanopore geometry that is permeable to hydrogen and helium, is signiﬁcantly less permeable to nitrogen, and is essentially impermeable to methane, thus validating previous suggestions that nanoporous graphene membranes can be used for gas separation. We also show that molecular permeation is strongly aﬀected by pore functionalization; this observation may be suﬃcient to explain the large discrepancy between simulated and experimentally measured transport rates through nanoporous graphene membranes.},

This work establishes an atomic-level understanding of the eﬀects of additional NPG layers, layer separation, and pore alignment on desalination performance, providing useful guidelines for the design of multilayer NPG membranes.},

But while previous studies have highlighted the potential of NPG as an RO membrane, there is less understanding as to whether NPG is strong enough to maintain its mechanical integrity under the high hydraulic pressures inherent to the RO desalination process. Here, we show that an NPG membrane can maintain its mechanical integrity in RO but that the choice of substrate for graphene is critical to this performance. Using molecular dynamics simulations and continuum fracture mechanics, we show that an appropriate substrate with openings smaller than 1 μm would allow NPG to withstand pressures exceeding 57 MPa (570 bar) or ten times more than typical pressures for seawater RO. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NPG membranes exhibit an unusual mechanical behavior in which greater porosity may help the membrane withstand even higher pressures.},

Through tuning of the pore creation process, we demonstrate nanoﬁltration membranes that reject small molecules but oﬀer high permeance to water or monovalent ions. Theoretical multiscale modeling of transport across the membranes reveals a disproportionate contribution of large pores to osmotic water ﬂux and diﬀusive solute transport and captures the observed trends in transport measurements except for the smallest pores.

Six graphene membranes were considered in which the carbon atoms of the pores were terminated by hydrogen or hydroxyl functional groups. The results demonstrate that water desalination occurs under external pressure and water ﬂux permeating the membranes scales linearly with external pressure and pore diameter. The hierarchy of water ﬂux through the functionalized graphene membranes was explained by potential of mean force. The salt rejection from smallest pore was 100\% and decreases as pore diameter increases. Both Naþ and ClÀ ions permeate through membrane with the largest pore, and the selectivity of the ions permeating exhibits a signiﬁcant correlation with functional group. The designed graphene membrane shows excellent performance in terms of both salt rejection and water transport. Ultrahigh water permeance of 785.6 L per m2\$h\$bar obtained is two or three orders of magnitude higher than current commercially available reverse osmosis (RO) and nanoﬁltration membranes. This simulation study provides a microscopic insight into water desalination in various functionalized graphene membranes and reveals governing factor for water ﬂux and also suggests a potential candidate as a RO membrane.},

Our results indicate that the membrane’s ability to prevent the salt passage depends critically on pore diameter with adequately sized pores allowing for water ﬂow while blocking ions. Further, an investigation into the role of chemical functional groups bonded to the edges of graphene pores suggests that commonly occurring hydroxyl groups can roughly double the water ﬂux thanks to their hydrophilic character. The increase in water ﬂux comes at the expense of less consistent salt rejection performance, which we attribute to the ability of hydroxyl functional groups to substitute for water molecules in the hydration shell of the ions. Overall, our results indicate that the water permeability of this material is several orders of magnitude higher than conventional reverse osmosis membranes, and that nanoporous graphene may have a valuable role to play for water puriﬁcation.},

The assorted results, many of which are applicable to simulations of nonbiological membranes, highlight the limitations of the homogeneous solubility diﬀusion model; support the utility of inhomogeneous solubility diﬀusion and compartmental models; underscore the need for comparison with experiment for both simple solvent systems (such as water/ hexadecane) and well-characterized membranes; and demonstrate the need for microsecond simulations for even simple permeants like water and oxygen. Undulations, subdiﬀusion, fractional viscosity dependence, periodic boundary conditions, and recent developments in the ﬁeld are also discussed. Last, while enhanced sampling methods and increasingly sophisticated treatments of diﬀusion add substantially to the repertoire of simulation-based approaches, they do not address directly the critical need for force ﬁelds with polarizability and multipoles, and constant pH methods.},

              ) an SONP with radius of 3.2 Å, and (
              ii
              ) single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with radii of 3–5 Å (these radii are comparable to those of the biological potassium K
              +
              channels). We find that the hydration shell of aqua Na
              +
              ion is smaller than that of aqua K
              +
              ion but notably more structured and less yielding. The aqua ions do not lower the diffusivity of water molecules in CNTs, but in SONP the diffusivity of aqua ions (Na
              +
              in particular) is strongly suppressed due to the rugged inner surface. Moreover, the aqua Na
              +
              ion requires higher formation energy than aqua K
              +
              ion in the hydrophobic nanochannels. As such, we find that the ion (K
              +
              vs. Na
              +
              ) selectivity of the (8, 8) CNT is ∼20× higher than that of SONP. Hence, the (8, 8) CNT is likely the most efficient artificial K
              +
              channel due in part to its special interior environment in which Na
              +
              can be fully solvated, whereas K
              +
              cannot. This work provides deeper insights into the physical chemistry behind selective ion transport in nanochannels.},

	abstract = {Fitting mathematical models with a direct connection to experimental observables to the outputs of molecular simulations can be a powerful tool for extracting important physical information from them. In this study, we present two new approaches that use stochastic time series modeling to predict long-time-scale behavior and macroscopic properties from molecular simulation, which can be generalized to other molecular systems where complex diﬀusion occurs. In our previous work, we studied long molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories of a cross-linked HII phase lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) membrane, where we observed subdiﬀusive solute transport behavior characterized by intermittent hops separated by periods of entrapment. In this work, we use our models to parameterize the behavior of the same systems, so we can generate characteristic trajectory realizations that can be used to predict solute mean-squared displacements (MSDs), solute ﬂux, and solute selectivity in macroscopic length pores. First, using anomalous diﬀusion theory, we show how solute dynamics can be modeled as a fractional diﬀusion process subordinate to a continuous time random walk. From the MD simulations, we parameterize the distribution of dwell times, hop lengths between dwells, and correlation between hops. We explore two variations of the anomalous diﬀusion modeling approach. The ﬁrst variation applies a single set of parameters to the solute displacements and the second applies two sets of parameters based on the solute’s radial distance from the closest pore center. Next, we present an approach that generalizes Markov state models, treating the conﬁgurational states of the system as a Markov process where each state has distinct transport properties. For each state and transition between states, we parameterize the distribution and temporal correlation structure of positional ﬂuctuations as a means of characterization and to allow us to predict solute MSDs. We show that both stochastic models reasonably reproduce the MSDs calculated from MD simulations. However, qualitative diﬀerences between MD and Markov state-dependent model-generated trajectories may in some cases limit their usefulness. With these parameterized stochastic models, we demonstrate how one can estimate the ﬂux of a solute across a macroscopic length pore and, based on these quantities, the membrane’s selectivity toward each solute. This work therefore helps to connect microscopic, chemically dependent solute motions that do not follow simple diﬀusive behavior with long-time-scale behavior, in an approach generalizable to many types of molecular systems with complex dynamics.},

	abstract = {Appropriate time series modeling of complex diﬀusion in soft matter systems on the microsecond time scale can provide a path toward inferring transport mechanisms and predicting bulk properties characteristic of much longer time scales. In this work we apply nonparametric Bayesian time series analysis, more speciﬁcally the sticky hierarchical Dirichlet process autoregressive hidden Markov model (HDP-AR-HMM) to solute center-of-mass trajectories generated from long molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in a cross-linked inverted hexagonal phase lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) membrane in order to automatically detect a variety of solute dynamical modes. We can better understand the mechanisms controlling these dynamical modes by grouping the states identiﬁed by the HDP-AR-HMM into clusters based on multiple metrics aimed at distinguishing solute behavior based on their ﬂuctuations, dwell times in each state, and positions within the inhomogeneous membrane structure. We analyze predominant clusters in order to relate their dynamical parameters to physical interactions between solutes and the membrane. Along with parameters of individual states, the HDP-AR-HMM simultaneously infers a transition matrix which allows us to stochastically propagate solute behavior from all of the independent trajectories onto arbitrary length time scales while still preserving the qualitative behavior characteristic of the MD trajectories. This aﬀords a direct connection to important macroscopic observables used to characterize performance like solute ﬂux and selectivity. This work provides a promising way to simultaneously identify transport mechanisms in nanoporous materials and project complex diﬀusive behavior on long time scales. Our enhanced understanding of the diverse range of solute behavior allows us to hypothesize design changes to LLC monomers aimed toward controlling the rates of solute passage, thus improving the selective performance of LLC membranes.},

          , 
            
              Lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs) formed by the self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules in a solvent (usually water) have attracted increasingly greater attention in the last few decades, especially the lamellar phase (L
              α
              ), the reversed bicontinuous cubic phase (Q
              2
              ) and the reversed hexagonal phase (H
              2
              ). Such phases offer promising prospects for encapsulation of a wide range of target molecules with various sizes and polarities owing to the unique internal structures. Also, different structures of mesophases can give rise to different diffusion coefficients. The bicontinuous cubic phase and the hexagonal phase have been demonstrated to control and sustain the release of active molecules. Furthermore, the structures are susceptible to many factors such as water content, temperature, pH, the presence of additives
              etc.
              Many researchers have been studying these influencing factors in order to accurately fabricate the desired phase. In this paper, we give a review of the characteristics of different structures of liquid crystalline phases, the influencing factors on the phase transition of liquid crystals and the relationship between structures of LLC and drug diffusion. We hope our review will provide some insights into how to manipulate in a controlled manner the rate of incorporating and transferring molecules by altering the structure of lyotropic mesophases.},

	abstract = {The synthesis and lyotropic liquid-crystalline (LLC) phase behavior of a homologous series of intrinsically cross-linkable gemini surfactants are described. These novel bis(alkyl-1,3-diene)-based phosphonium gemini amphiphiles exhibit “normal” hexagonal (HI), Type I bicontinuous cubic (QI), and lamellar (LR) phases in water, and can be photocross-linked with retention of phase architecture in each case. On the basis of their locations on the phase diagram, their powder X-ray diffraction profiles, and the physical properties of the cross-linked materials, the QI phases formed by these gemini monomers are consistent with four possible bicontinuous cubic architectures with P or I space group symmetry that have been identified previously for small molecule amphiphiles. The extent of polymerization (i.e., the degree of diene conversion) achieved in the LLC phases was determined to be in the 23\% to 71\% range using UV-vis spectrometry, which is more than sufficient to extensively stabilize the systems. The resulting cross-linked HI, LR, and QI phases are stable up to 300 °C in air. To our knowledge, these reactive amphiphiles constitute the first example of a polymerizable gemini surfactant, and the first example of a cross-linkable amphiphile system that can be polymerized in both the HI and a QI mesophase with retention of phase microstructure.},

However, the narrowest of such pores, perhaps best called Single Digit Nanopores (SDNs) and deﬁned as those with regular diameters less than 10 nm, have only recently been accessible experimentally for precision transport measurements. This Review summarizes recent experiments on pores in this size range that yield surprising results, pointing toward extraordinary transport eﬃciencies and selectivities for SDN systems. These studies have identiﬁed critical gaps in our understanding of nanoscale hydrodynamics, molecular sieving, ﬂuidic structure, and thermodynamics. These knowledge gaps are, in turn, an opportunity to discover and understand fundamentally new mechanisms of molecular and ionic transport at the nanometer scale that may inspire a host of new technologies, from novel membranes for separations and water puriﬁcation to new gas-permeable materials and energy storage devices. Here we highlight seven critical knowledge gaps in the study of SDNs and identify the need for new approaches to address these topics.},

	abstract = {Current commercial nanoﬁltration and reverse osmosis membranes are limited in scope and performance due to their physicochemical properties. Desalination of hydraulic fracturing wastewater poses a particular challenge to membrane ﬁltration given the high concentrations of both organic compounds and salts present in these waters. The recently-developed nanoporous, bicontinuous cubic, lyotropic liquid crystal, thin-ﬁlm-composite polymer membrane (TFC QI membrane), having unique physicochemical properties, enables an alternative treatment of hydraulic fracturing wastewater. Speciﬁcally, the TFC QI membrane recovers the organic compounds from this high-salinity wastewater, enabling biodegradation to occur after desalination. However, other performance criteria must be demonstrated for a membrane to reach application. The work presented herein demonstrates the stable performance of the TFC QI membrane during 66 h of cross-ﬂow ﬁltration of hydraulic fracturing produced water. Compared to the commercial NF90 membrane, the TFC QI membrane recovered a larger portion of the organic compounds, had a higher thickness-normalized water ﬂux, and fouled less. The combination of the TFC QI membrane’s selectivity with its reduced fouling propensity makes possible a treatment for hydraulic fracturing wastewater and other complex aqueous streams inaccessible by most commercial membranes, motivating the further study and development of the TFC QI membrane.},

	abstract = {A thin-ﬁlm composite, bicontinuous cubic lyotropic liquid crystal polymer (TFC QI) membrane with uniformsize, ionic nanopores was studied for the treatment of hydraulic fracturing ﬂowback water. The TFC QI membrane performance was compared to those of a commercial nanoﬁltration (NF) membrane (NF270) and a commercial reverse osmosis (RO) membrane (SW30HR) for the ﬁltration of ﬂowback water from the DenverJulesburg Basin. The permeability, salt rejection, and organic solute rejection for each membrane was evaluated. The results illustrate that the TFC QI membrane maintained its performance to a similar degree as the commercial NF and RO membranes while demonstrating a unique selectivity not observed in the commercial membranes. Speciﬁcally, the TFC QI membrane rejected 75\% of the salt while recovering 9.6\% of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and 50\% of the water. Of particular interest was the recovery of labile DOC, which was assessed through biodegradation experiments. Analysis following biodegradation of the TFC QI membrane permeate demonstrates the membrane's ability to recover labile DOC in a reduced-saline permeate. Improved recovery of labile DOC (increased to 22\%) was demonstrated by reducing the pH of the ﬂowback water. Therefore, the selectivity of the TFC QI membrane provides an opportunity to recover resources from hydraulic fracturing ﬂowback.},

Monovalent organosulfonate anions of various sizes were completely exchanged as the counterion at the pore walls to explore the impact of anion size on uncharged molecular solute rejection and water permeance. It was found that larger organosulfonate anions associated at the pore walls induced a higher rejection of uncharged solutes and a lower water permeance. The change in selectivity of the nanopores was described quantitatively through the calculation of the eﬀective pore radius. The eﬀective pore radius in these modiﬁed membranes was found to vary from 0.9 ± 0.2 to 0.55 ± 0.08 nm depending on the resident organosulfonate counterion, demonstrating sub-1-nm resolution in pore size manipulation. An empirical model was used to demonstrate that physicochemical properties (molecular volume and hydrophobicity) of the resident counterion correlate with the observed solute rejection, suggesting that the counterion can be chosen to target a desired membrane performance. The ability to manipulate uniform, nmsized pores with sub-1-nm resolution via simple anion-exchange oﬀers a new avenue to tailor nanoﬁltration membrane performance.},

	abstract = {Glassy polymers are utilized in numerous applications ranging from light-weight structural materials to membranes for industrial gas separation. In this study, we quantify the ability of non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations to predict mechanical properties of glassy polymers based on different modeling approaches: force ﬁeld selection, number of polymer chains in the simulation cell, and polymer builder algorithm. The polymers analyzed in this work are poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), poly(propylene) (PP), and a polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM-1). PMMA samples were synthesized in silico using three different methods: continuous conﬁgurational biased Monte Carlo, pseudo-selfavoiding random walk, and a generalized simulated polymerization approach. Following the application of a consistent equilibration approach for each PMMA sample, stress–strain data from simulated tensile testing revealed that the choice of polymer builder algorithm or number of chains comprising the simulation cell did not have signiﬁcant impact on the predicted elastic modulus. Force ﬁeld selection effects have been analyzed by applying generalized force ﬁelds (GAFF and DREIDING) to each PMMA and PP sample and were found to be the most inﬂuencing factor studied. For these polymers, it was found that the DREIDING force ﬁeld provides excellent agreement with experimental tensile moduli, ∼3.25 GPa and ∼1.53 GPa for PMMA and PP, respectively, while GAFF provides a systematic overestimation of the modulus by approximately 1.0 GPa.},

	abstract = {Not all nanopores are created equal. By deﬁnition, nanopores have characteristic diameters or conduit widths between ∼1 and 100 nm. However, the narrowest of such pores, perhaps best called Single Digit Nanopores (SDNs) and deﬁned as those with regular diameters less than 10 nm, have only recently been accessible experimentally for precision transport measurements. This Review summarizes recent experiments on pores in this size range that yield surprising results, pointing toward extraordinary transport eﬃciencies and selectivities for SDN systems. These studies have identiﬁed critical gaps in our understanding of nanoscale hydrodynamics, molecular sieving, ﬂuidic structure, and thermodynamics. These knowledge gaps are, in turn, an opportunity to discover and understand fundamentally new mechanisms of molecular and ionic transport at the nanometer scale that may inspire a host of new technologies, from novel membranes for separations and water puriﬁcation to new gas-permeable materials and energy storage devices. Here we highlight seven critical knowledge gaps in the study of SDNs and identify the need for new approaches to address these topics.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to investigate water desalination through functionalized nanoporous graphene membranes. Six graphene membranes were considered in which the carbon atoms of the pores were terminated by hydrogen or hydroxyl functional groups. The results demonstrate that water desalination occurs under external pressure and water ﬂux permeating the membranes scales linearly with external pressure and pore diameter. The hierarchy of water ﬂux through the functionalized graphene membranes was explained by potential of mean force. The salt rejection from smallest pore was 100\% and decreases as pore diameter increases. Both Naþ and ClÀ ions permeate through membrane with the largest pore, and the selectivity of the ions permeating exhibits a signiﬁcant correlation with functional group. The designed graphene membrane shows excellent performance in terms of both salt rejection and water transport. Ultrahigh water permeance of 785.6 L per m2\$h\$bar obtained is two or three orders of magnitude higher than current commercially available reverse osmosis (RO) and nanoﬁltration membranes. This simulation study provides a microscopic insight into water desalination in various functionalized graphene membranes and reveals governing factor for water ﬂux and also suggests a potential candidate as a RO membrane.},

	abstract = {The water ﬁltration performance of a supported, nanostructured, lyotropic (i.e., surfactant) liquid crystal (LLC) polymer membrane containing uniform, sub-1-nm pores was examined in more detail using more extensive aqueous ﬁltration tests and a more structurally representative nanopore model. This nanoporous membrane material is based on the radical cross-linking of an ionic, LLC monomer that forms a type I bicontinuous cubic (QI) phase with a 3D interconnected, annulus-like, water pore network. Previously, initial water transport studies using a limited number of solutes demonstrated initial proof-of-concept that this LLC polymer membrane can reject small molecules based on molecular size discrimination. In this study, more comprehensive transport experiments using aqueous solutions containing a wider range of different size neutral organic molecules and salt ions were undertaken. The results of these experiments showed that the LLC polymer membrane has a rejection performance in between that of a commercial, high-performance reverse osmosis (RO) membrane (Dow SW30HR) and that of a conventional porous nanoﬁltration (NF) membrane (Dow NF-270) with non-uniform pore sizes. Speciﬁcally, the LLC membrane was found to reject inorganic salt ions much better than a NF membrane, and on a level comparable to a RO membrane. It does not reject small neutral organic solutes as well as a RO membrane, but it was found to reject organic solutes better than a conventional NF membrane. Also, the organic solute rejection behavior was ﬁtted using two different Donnan-steric pore models (DSPM) with different pore shapes (i.e., cylindrical and straight slit). It was determined that the QI-phase LLC membrane has an effective pore radius between 0.29 nm and 0.45 nm. This modeling also suggested that the LLC nanopores are indeed uniform in size. Initial chemical stability and fouling experiments suggest this nanoporous LLC polymer membrane is also very resistant to chlorine degradation and protein fouling. This combination of properties makes this nanoporous LLC polymer a very promising membrane material for water desalination and other NF processes.},

	abstract = {A method is proposed to measure the water permeability of membrane channels by means of molecular dynamics simulations. By applying a constant force to the bulk water molecules and a counter force on the complementary system, a hydrostatic pressure difference across the membrane can be established, producing a net directional water flow. The hydraulic or osmotic permeability can then be determined by the ratio of the water flux and the pressure difference. The method is applied and tested on an aquaglyceroporin channel through a series of simulations totaling 5 ns in duration.},

High accuracy quantum chemical methods were used to scan φ, ψ, χ1, and χ2 potential energy surfaces for blocked dipeptides. New Fourier coeﬃcients for the dihedral angle terms of the OPLS-AA force ﬁeld were ﬁt to these surfaces, utilizing a Boltzmann-weighted error function and systematically examining the eﬀects of weighting temperature. To prevent overﬁtting to the available data, a minimal number of new residue-speciﬁc and peptide-speciﬁc torsion terms were developed. Extensive experimental solution-phase and quantum chemical gas-phase benchmarks were used to assess the quality of the new parameters, named OPLS-AA/M, demonstrating signiﬁcant improvement over previous OPLS-AA force ﬁelds. A Boltzmann weighting temperature of 2000 K was determined to be optimal for ﬁtting the new Fourier coeﬃcients for dihedral angle parameters. Conclusions are drawn from the results for best practices for developing new torsion parameters for protein force ﬁelds.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) together with the adaptive biasing force (ABF) and metadynamics free energy calculation methods was used to investigate the permeation properties of salt water through poly(amide) thin ﬁlm composite reverse osmosis membranes. The thin ﬁlms were generated by annealing an amorphous cell of poly(amide) chains through an MD method. The MD results showed they have typical structural properties of the active layer of thin ﬁlm composite membranes and comparable water diffusivity (2.13 Â 10À5 cm2/s for the ﬁlm with a density of 1.06 g/cm3) and permeability (9.27 Â 10À15 cm3 cm/cm2s Pa) to experimental data. The simulations of water permeation through the ﬁlms under different transmembrane pressures revealed the behaviours of water molecules in the thin ﬁlms and the dynamic regimes of water permeation, including Brownian diffusion, ﬂush and jump diffusion regimes. The intermolecular interactions of water and ions with poly(amide) chains showed a strong dependence on the local structure of ﬁlms. The attraction between water and ploy(amide) molecules can be up to 8.5 kcal/mol in dense polymer regions and 5 kcal/mol in the pores of about 3 nm. The ABF and metadynamics simulations produced the proﬁles of free energy potential of water and ions along the depth of the thin ﬁlms, which provided important information for quantitatively determining the barrier energy required for water permeation and rejection of ions. The thin ﬁlm with a density of 1.06 g/cm3 and a thickness of 6 nm offers a rejection to Naþ but a slight absorption of ClÀ (0.25 kcal/ mol) at 0.3–0.4 nm distance to its surface. Water molecules must overcome 63 kcal/mol energy to move to the centre of the ﬁlm. The dependences of the barrier energy and the water–polymer interaction energy on the local free volume size in the thin ﬁlm were analysed. The simulations of water permeation under high transmembrane pressures showed a nonlinear response of the concentration and distribution of water molecules in the ﬁlm to the imposed pressure. Compaction of the ﬁlm segments close to the porous substrate and water congestion in dense regions signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced the water permeation when the membrane was operated under pressures of more than 3.0 MPa.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations often adopt coarse-grained (CG) models to investigate lengthand time-scales that cannot be eﬀectively addressed with atomically detailed models. However, the eﬀective potentials that govern CG models are conﬁguration-dependent free energies with signiﬁcant entropic contributions that have important consequences for the transferability and thermodynamic properties of CG models. This review summarizes recent work investigating the fundamental origin and practical ramiﬁcations of these entropic contributions, as well as their sensitivity to the CG mapping. We ﬁrst analyze the energetic and entropic components of the many-body potential of mean force. By adopting a simple model for protein ﬂuctuations, we examine how these components vary with the CG representation. We then introduce a “dual potential” approach for addressing these entropic considerations in more complex systems, such as ortho-terphenyl (OTP). We demonstrate that this dual approach not only accurately describes the structure and energetic properties of the underlying atomic model, but also accurately predicts the temperature-dependence of the CG potentials. Furthermore, by considering two diﬀerent CG representations of OTP, we elucidate how these contributions vary with resolution. In sum, we hope this work will prove useful for improving the transferability and thermodynamic properties of CG models for soft materials.},

	abstract = {Single-molecule localization microscopy allows practitioners to locate and track labeled molecules in biological systems. When extracting diffusion coefficients from the resulting trajectories, it is common practice to perform a linear fit on mean-squared-displacement curves. However, this strategy is suboptimal and prone to errors. Recently, it was shown that the increments between the observed positions provide a good estimate for the diffusion coefficient, and their statistics are well-suited for likelihood-based analysis methods. Here, we revisit the problem of extracting diffusion coefficients from single-particle tracking experiments subject to static noise and dynamic motion blur using the principle of maximum likelihood. Taking advantage of an efficient real-space formulation, we extend the model to mixtures of subpopulations differing in their diffusion coefficients, which we estimate with the help of the expectation–maximization algorithm. This formulation naturally leads to a probabilistic assignment of trajectories to subpopulations. We employ the theory to analyze experimental tracking data that cannot be explained with a single diffusion coefficient. We test how well a dataset conforms to the assumptions of a diffusion model and determine the optimal number of subpopulations with the help of a quality factor of known analytical distribution. To facilitate use by practitioners, we provide a fast open-source implementation of the theory for the efficient analysis of multiple trajectories in arbitrary dimensions simultaneously.},

Using Monte Carlo simulations that implement the Gillespie algorithm, we simulate multivalent diﬀusive transport processes for 100 distinct walker designs. Informed by our simulation results, we derive an analytical expression for the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of a general multivalent diﬀusive process as a function of multivalency, span, and dissociation constant Kd.

Our VS hybrid method was also applied to simulate a small lipid vesicle, with the inner leaﬂet and interior solvent represented in AA, and the outer leaﬂet together with exterior solvent at the CG level.

	abstract = {Phospholipids, which are an integral component of cell membranes, exhibit a rich variety of lamellar phases modulated by temperature and composition. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have greatly enhanced our understanding of phospholipid membranes by capturing experimentally observed phases and phase transitions at molecular resolution. However, the ripple (Pβ′) membrane phase, observed as an intermediate phase below the main gel-to-liquid crystalline transition with some lipids, has been challenging to capture with MD simulations, both at allatom and coarse-grained (CG) resolutions. Here, with an aggregate ∼2.5 μs all-atom and ∼122 μs CGMD simulations, we systematically assess the ability of six CG MARTINI 1,2dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) lipid and water force-ﬁeld (FF) variants, parametrized to capture the DPPC gel and ﬂuid phases, for their ability to capture the Pβ′ phase, and compared observations with those from an all-atom FF. Upon cooling from the ﬂuid phase to below the phase transition temperature with smaller (380-lipid) and larger ({\textgreater}2200-lipid) MARTINI and all-atom (CHARMM36 FF) DPPC lipid bilayers, we observed that smaller bilayers with both all-atom and MARTINI FFs sampled interdigitated Pβ′ and ripple-like states, respectively. However, while all-atom simulations of the larger DPPC membranes exhibited the formation of the Pβ′ phase, MARTINI membranes did not sample interdigitated ripple-like states at larger system sizes. We then demonstrated that the ripple-like states in smaller MARTINI membranes were kinetically trapped structures caused by ﬁnite size eﬀects rather than being representative of true Pβ′ phases. We showed that a MARTINI FF variant that could capture the tilted Lβ′ gel phase, a prerequisite for stabilizing the Pβ′ phase, was unable to capture the rippled phase upon cooling. Our study reveals that the current MARTINI FFs (including MARTINI3) may require speciﬁc reparametrization of the interaction potentials to stabilize lipid interdigitation, a characteristic of the ripple phase.},

Owing to their complex microporous structure on one side and the intricate biochemical nature of various materials used in the structure, separative membrane materials possess peculiar degrees of complications. More notably, as nanocomposite materials are often integrated into separative membranes, thin-film nanocomposites and porous separative nanocomposite materials could possess an additional level of complexity with regard to the nanoscale in­ teractions brought to the structure. This critical review intends to cover the recent methods used to assess membranes and membrane materials. Incorporation of MD in membrane technology-related fields such as desalination, fuel cell-based energy production, blood purification through hemodialysis, etc., were briefly covered. Accordingly, this review could be used to understand the current extent of MD applications for sepa­ rative membranes.

The coarse-grained (CG) Martini force ﬁeld has successfully captured spontaneous separation of ternary membranes into a liquid-disordered and a liquid-ordered domain. With all-atom (AA) models, however, phase separation is much harder to achieve due to the slow underlying dynamics. To remedy this problem, here, we apply the virtual site (VS) hybrid method on a ternary membrane composed of saturated lipids, unsaturated lipids, and cholesterol to investigate the phase separation. The VS scheme couples the two membrane leaﬂets at CG and AA resolution. We found that the rapid phase separation reached by the CG leaﬂet can accelerate and guide this process in the AA leaﬂet.},

The barrier function is maintained by stacked layers of saturated long-chain ceramides, free fatty acids, and cholesterol. This structure is formed through a reorganization of glycosylceramide-based bilayers with cubic-like symmetry into ceramide-based bilayers with stacked lamellar symmetry. The process is accompanied by deglycosylation of glycosylceramides and dehydration of the skin barrier lipid structure. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation, we show the effects of deglycosylation and dehydration on bilayers of human skin glycosylceramides and ceramides, folded in three dimensions with cubic (gyroid) symmetry. Deglycosylation of glycosylceramides destabilizes the cubic lipid bilayer phase and triggers a cubic-to-lamellar phase transition. Furthermore, subsequent dehydration of the deglycosylated lamellar ceramide system closes the remaining pores between adjacent lipid layers and locally induces a ceramide chain transformation from a hairpin-like to a splayed conformation.},

	abstract = {The performance of a polymer medium as a separation membrane is determined by the dissolution free energy ΔG and diﬀusion coeﬃcient D of the permeant. In this work, ΔG and D of water are investigated with all-atom molecular dynamics simulation in a wide variety of polymer species in the amorphous state. The computed ΔG is shown to agree well with the experimental value for linear homopolymers, and the degrees of polymerization of the homopolymers do not aﬀect ΔG when they are beyond ∼10. The copolymers of ethylene-vinylidene diﬂuoride, ethylene-vinyl acetate, and ethylene-acrylamide are then examined by changing the repeating patterns of the constituent monomers in both the periodic and graft forms. It is found that ΔG is determined primarily by the overall compositions of the monomers and is not aﬀected by the copolymerization topology (periodic or graft). The hydrophobicity of the copolymer is enhanced, furthermore, when the hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the ethylene and nonethylene parts are well contrasted and those parts are fragmented along the polymer chain. According to the computed D, the diﬀusivity of water tends to be larger when the (co)polymer is more hydrophobic and ΔG is more positive. D is actually seen to vary by orders of magnitude with the polymer structures, while the eﬀect of the polymer species on the water permeation is stronger for ΔG than for D.},

	abstract = {In this study, we present an atomistic simulation study of several physicochemical properties of polyamide (PA) membranes formed from interfacial polymerization or from a molecular-layer-by-layer (mLbL) on a silicon wafer. These membranes are composed of meta-phenylenediamine (MPD) and benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid chloride (TMC) for potential reverse osmosis (RO) applications. The mLbL membrane generation procedure and the force ﬁeld models were validated, by comparison with available experimental data, for hydrated density, membrane swelling, and pore size distributions of PA membranes formed by interfacial polymerization. Physicochemical properties such as density, free volume, thickness, the degree of cross-linking, atomic compositions, and average molecular orientation (which is relevant for the mLbL membranes) are compared for these diﬀerent processes. The mLbL membranes are investigated systematically with respect to TMC monomer growth rate per substrate surface area, MPD/TMC ratio, and the number of mLbL deposition cycles. Atomistic simulations show that the mLbL deposition generates membranes with a constant ﬁlm growth if both the TMC monomer growth rate and MPD/TMC monomer ratio are kept constant. The ﬁlm growth rate increases with TMC monomer growth rate or MPD/TMC ratio. Furthermore, it was found on one hand that the mLbL membrane density and free volume varies signiﬁcantly with respect to the TMC monomer growth rate, while on the other hand the degree of cross-linking and the atomic composition varies considerably with the MPD/TMC ratio. Additionally, it was found that both TMC and MPD orient at a tilted angle with respect to the substrate surface, where their angular distribution and average angle orientation depend on both the TMC growth rate and the number of deposition cycles. This study illustrates that molecular simulations can play a crucial role in the understanding of structural properties that can empower the design of the next generation RO membranes created from molecular-layer-by-layer (mLbL) on a silicon wafer.},

	abstract = {A molecular-level understanding of the structure−property relationship of polyamide (PA) active layers in thin-ﬁlm-composite membranes remains unclear. We developed an approach to build and hydrate the PA layer in molecular dynamics simulations and reproduced realistic membrane properties, which enabled us to examine the composition−structure−permeability relationships at the molecular level. We discovered the variation of pore size distributions in the dry PA structures at diﬀerent monomer compositions, leading to diﬀerent water cluster distributions and wetting properties of hydrated PA ﬁlms. Membrane swelling was linearly dependent on the degree of cross-linking (DC), and higher water ﬂux was obtained in the more swelling-prone PA ﬁlms because of the transition in water transport mechanisms. Continuum-like and jumping transport both occurred in PA ﬁlms with smaller DC, where visible and more persistent channels existed. In the denser ﬁlms, water molecules relied only on the on-and-oﬀ channels to jump from one cavity to another; however, jumping transport was more pronounced even in the less dense PA ﬁlms, and all the PA structures exhibited oscillations, which provided evidence for the solution-diﬀusion model rather than the pore-ﬂow model. The results not only contribute to fundamental understanding but also provide insights into the molecule-level design for next-generation membranes.},

Because the simulated systems keep increasing both in size and complexity, the analysis of MD trajectories need to be computationally efﬁcient while being robust enough to perform analysis on membranes that may be curved or deformed due to their size and/or protein-lipid interactions. This work presents a new software named FATSLiM (‘Fast Analysis Toolbox for Simulations of Lipid Membranes’) that can extract physical properties from MD simulations of membranes (with or without interacting proteins). Because it relies on the calculation of local normals, FATSLiM does not depend of the bilayer morphology and thus can handle with the same accuracy vesicles for instance. Thanks to an efﬁciency-driven development, it is also fast and consumes a rather low amount of memory.},
